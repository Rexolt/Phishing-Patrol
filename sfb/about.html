        <h1>About the Phishing Protection Extension</h1>

        <p>The Phishing Protection Extension is designed to help users stay safe online by blocking access to websites that are identified as malicious or potentially harmful. This extension provides an additional layer of security by analyzing websites and preventing users from visiting sites known for phishing, malware distribution, scams, and other cyber threats.</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <h2>Why This Extension Was Created</h2>
            <p>The internet can be a dangerous place, with cybercriminals constantly finding new ways to exploit vulnerabilities and trick users. This extension was created to give users a simple, yet effective, tool to protect themselves from some of the most common online threats. Whether you're concerned about phishing attacks or simply want to ensure a safer browsing experience, this extension can help provide peace of mind.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time Blocking:</strong> The extension blocks known malicious websites in real-time, preventing access before any harm can be done.</li>
            <li><strong>Customizable Blocklists:</strong> Users can add their own URLs or external blocklists to customize the protection offered by the extension.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Updates:</strong> The extension automatically updates its database of harmful URLs every 24 hours, ensuring that users are always protected against the latest threats.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly Notifications:</strong> When a site is blocked, the extension displays a detailed notification explaining the reason for the block.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The Phishing Protection Extension works by comparing the URLs you visit with a database of known malicious sites. If a match is found, the extension immediately blocks the page and displays a notification explaining why the site is considered dangerous. Users can also manually add sites to the blocklist or use additional blocklists from trusted sources.</p>

        <p>The extension relies on several reputable sources to identify threats, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>URLhaus</li>
            <li>OpenPhish</li>
            <li>Malware Domain List</li>
            <li>BlockList.de</li>
            <li>And others...</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Commitment to Privacy</h2>
        <div class="privacy">
            <strong>Your Privacy is Our Priority:</strong>
            <p>We are strong advocates of protecting user data and ensuring privacy. This extension does not collect any data from your browsing activities, and we do not use any analytics tools. Your online activities are your own, and we are committed to keeping it that way. We believe in providing security without compromising privacy.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <p>While the Phishing Protection Extension provides significant protection against many online threats, it is not a substitute for comprehensive security software. Users should still practice safe browsing habits and consider using additional security tools, such as antivirus software, to fully protect themselves from all types of cyber threats.</p>

        <h2>Support and Contributions</h2>
        <p>This extension is an open-source project, and contributions from the community are welcome. Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a new feature, or contribute code, your involvement is appreciated.</p>

        <p>If you have any questions or need assistance, please refer to the documentation or contact support through the project's GitHub repository.</p>

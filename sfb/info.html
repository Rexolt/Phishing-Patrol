    <h3><strong>1. Phishing Attacks</strong></h3>
    <p>
        <strong>What is Phishing?</strong><br>
Phishing is a type of cyber attack where attackers attempt to trick users into providing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, or credit card details, by pretending to be a legitimate entity.<br> This is typically done through fake websites that closely resemble real ones, such as banking or email service login pages.<br>

Why is it Dangerous?
Phishing sites can lead to identity theft, financial loss, and unauthorized access to your personal accounts. Once attackers have your information, they can use it for malicious purposes, such as draining your bank account,<br> committing fraud in your name, or selling your data on the dark web.
